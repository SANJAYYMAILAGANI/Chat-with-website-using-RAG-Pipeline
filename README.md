# Chat-with-website-using-RAG-Pipeline
This Python script is designed to scrape content from a given website URL using the requests library to make an HTTP request and BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML.

Key Steps:
Requesting Website Data: It sends an HTTP GET request to the website with a user-agent header that mimics a browser. This helps avoid being blocked by basic anti-bot protections.

Parsing HTML: After receiving the response, the script parses the HTML using BeautifulSoup to extract all text within paragraph (<p>) tags. This ensures that only relevant content is fetched.

Error Handling: The function includes error handling that checks if the request is successful (status code 200) and catches any exceptions during the scraping process. If thereâ€™s an issue, the function prints an error message and returns None.

Result: The function returns the extracted text, which can be further processed or used for analysis.

The script provides a basic method for scraping textual data from websites and can be extended to handle more complex websites or different types of content (e.g., headings, links, or images).
